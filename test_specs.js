// Block 18 Workshop: Writing Test Sepcifications

// Overview
// One of the first steps for many TDD projects is determining which tests need to be written for a project, feature, or piece of code. These range from unit tests (at a very low level, what result we should expect from calling a specific function or piece of code), to functional tests (what does our website or app need to do when a user performs some action).

// In this workshop, you are going to write instructions for tests, often known as test specifications, or test specs, for a series of prompts.

// Unit test specifications should take the form of:

// -Expect [action] to be [some result]
// -Example: For the prompt "A function called "addition" that returns the sum of two input integers", your tests might include:
//     -Expect addition(2, 3) to be a number
//     -Expect addition(2, 3) to be equal to 5
//     -Expect addition("a", 3) to be an error

// Functional test specifications can be worded slightly more naturally:

// -When a user [does something with some parameters], [some thing should happen]
// -Example: For the prompt was "A login and signup page that allows Single Sign-On with Google", your tests might include:
//     -When a user clicks "Log In" without filling in any information, they should be shown an error and prompted to sign up if they have not yet.
//     -When a user clicks "Log In" but has filled out an incorrect login or password, they should be shown an error and prompted to sign up if they have not yet.
//     -When a user clicks "Log In" and has filled in their login and password correctly, they should be taken to their dashboard.
//     -When a user clicks "Create Account" without filling in any information, they should be shown an error.
//     -When a user clicks "Create Account" with an invalid email address or password, they should be shown an error.
//     -When a user clicks the "Sign Up with Google" button, they should be taken through the Google authentication process.
//     -When a user clicks "Log In with Google", they should be logged in through Google, or taken through the Google authentication process if they do not already have an account.

// Prompts:

// For each prompt below:

// -Read the prompt.
// -Identify the expectations.
// -Write specifications for all the tests that would be useful for that prompt.
//     -Try to take any "edge cases," or unexpected circumstances, into account, and write test specs for them.
//     -Try not to write extraneous tests!

// Unit Tests:

// 1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

// 2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.
//     -Example: concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])
//         -...should result in [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]
//     -Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the code should behave:
//         -What should happen with unexpected inputs?
//             -What kinds of unexpected inputs should we worry about?
//         -What should happen when there are multiples of the same odd number in the arrays? (Hint: We gave you the answer to this one in the example above.)

// Functional Tests:

// 1. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.
//     -Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the feature should behave:
//         -What should happen if the cart is empty?
//         -What needs to be shown to the user at each step of check out?
//         -What behaviors of this feature does the prompt miss or gloss over?
//     -Hint: Observe the shopping cart and checkout features of some popular websites to get some ideas!
